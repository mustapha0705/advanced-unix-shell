# Advanced Custom Unix Shell

---

## 1. Project Overview

**Brief Description:**

Advanced Shell is a custom-built UNIX command line interpreter developed in C, designed to replicate the core functionality of the standard `/bin/sh` shell. The project addresses the challenge of understanding low-level operating system interactions by implementing a fully functional shell from scratch. It handles user input processing, command execution via fork-exec model, and PATH resolution for executable lookup. Additionally, it provides comprehensive error handling and memory management—all while adhering to strict coding standards and best practices.
